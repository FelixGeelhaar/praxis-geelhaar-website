# Praxis Geelhaar

This is the repository of the website (frontend code) written with Gatsby (actually our first page with Gatsby).
In this project we're using Gatsby along with React, emotion/core (CSS-in-JS), a external headless content management system running with Directus and Cloudinary as a Tranformer for media assets

The website just implemented the "old" designs and will be adjusted as we've a bit more time to do it, but already at that point of time, it's responsive, which it wasn't before.

## Development

As this project uses Gatsby and uses a Gatsby-Starter-Boilerplate as foundation it comes along with yarn, prettier and React.
In order to start development, we need a .env.development with Cloudinary and Directus access. See .env.EXAMPLE.

Having the .env.development in place enables us to start development through `yarn develop`.

## Work in progress

This repository is work in progress and will be enhanced soon.
And tests have to be written too, unfortunately we had no time yet.
